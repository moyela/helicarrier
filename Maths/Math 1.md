# Find all positive integer pairs: a and b, such that: √a + √b = √2009

## √a + √b = √2009

If we factorize √2009, the equation becomes:
### √a + √b = 7√41

If we change the values of √a and √b:
√a = x√41 
√b = y√41

It becomes:
### x√41 + y√41 = 7√41

So x + y = 7
The positive integer pairs that equal 7 are (0 and 7), (1 and 6), (2 and 5), and (3 and 4).
I have four possibe equations for the solution:

x√41 + y√41  = 0√41 + 7√41 = 7√41
x√41 + y√41  = 1√41 + 6√41 = 7√41
x√41 + y√41  = 2√41 + 5√41 = 7√41
x√41 + y√41  = 3√41 + 4√41 = 7√41

If I simplify the equation, 
### √a + √b  = √0 + √2009 = √2009
### √a + √b  = √41 + √1476 = √2009
### √a + √b  = √164 + √1025 = √2009
### √a + √b  = √369 + √656 = √2009

So a and b have four solutions: (0, 2009), (41, 1476), (164, 1025), and (368, 656)
